<h3 id="info">More about being a T1D Cyborg</h3>
<p>I have Type 1 Diabetes, and I am using an artificial pancreas called a loop. I refer to myself as a Type 1 Diabetes cyborg, or a T1D cyborg, as I replaced a dysfunctional organ (my pancreas) through a technical device. Ask me all about it, I'm happy to explain every detail of it. </p>
