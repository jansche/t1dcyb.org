<p>I do Developer Relations, and I'd love to shape, structure (and potentially lead) DevRel for your awesome company. You can hire me. This is what I am best at: </p>
<ul>
<li>Building programs for creating and maintaining a relationship with developers</li>
<li>Advocating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</li>
<li>Leading teams empathically by servant leadership principles</li>
<li>Learning. I'm always learning.</li>
<li>Growing my and others mindsets</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently working in DevRel at Microsoft, as I did for the last decade. Now I'm open for a change.</p>
<p><h2>Contact me to see if we are a fit!</h2></p>
